# Git Configuration - Quick Setup

## What It Means:

Git needs to know who you are for commit tracking. This is standard setup.

## Quick Fix:

Run these commands in your terminal (replace with your info):

```powershell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Example:

```powershell
git config --global user.name "Omraje"
git config --global user.email "omraje5@example.com"
```

## After Setting:

Then continue with the build. The git config is saved globally, so you won't need to do this again.

## What to Use:

- **Name**: Your actual name or any name you want
- **Email**: Your email address (can be any email, doesn't need to be real)

**Just run those two commands and then continue the build!**
