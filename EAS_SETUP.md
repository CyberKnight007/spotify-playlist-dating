# EAS Project Setup

## What's Happening:

EAS needs to configure your project for the first time. This is normal!

## What to Do:

**Type `Y` or `yes` and press Enter**

This will:
- ✅ Create EAS project configuration
- ✅ Link your project to Expo
- ✅ Set up build settings
- ✅ Continue with the build

## After You Say Yes:

The build will continue automatically. You'll see:
- Project configuration
- Build starting
- Progress updates

## This Only Happens Once:

After this first setup, future builds will start immediately without this prompt.

**Just type `Y` and press Enter!** ✅
